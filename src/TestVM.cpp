// Description : A simple virtual machine for testing things out. Goal is a *very* simplified x86-like assembly language, which makes it easy to rewrite assembly for real processors.
// (Assembler should be more or less close to NASM Intel for x86, with our registers and stuff.)
// Should still be CISC, though.
