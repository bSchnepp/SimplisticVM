# SimplisticVM
Simple attempt at implementing a virtual machine, because why not.
Architecture is 64-bit, and intended to try and be as minimalistic as possible for Waypoint. (Simulate the bare minimum expected of a processor where Waypoint will be supported.)

Nice looking readme is a todo.


Dependencies:
  - Requires some sort of an X server.
  - That's it! Goal is to have as few dependencies as possible, aiming for maximum compatibility with the fewest libraries possible.
